logbook
=======

A logbook for software engineers.

Let's loosely define a logbook as:

  A record of important events.

Here is the barebones interface to the logbook:

    <leader>ll
          Opens the entries of the logbook in quickfix

    <leader>le
          Creates an entry in the logbook

configuration
=============

Just make sure you have the directory `~/.logbook`
